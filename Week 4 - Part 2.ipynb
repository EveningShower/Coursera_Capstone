    "    Redfin has an unofficial API which can be used to create a csv file of houses which meet criteria.  The process to download a csv file with the API is briefly described here: https://support.redfin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016476931-Downloading-Data.  When the link for this option is examined, it can be seen that the parameters can be altered to produce a csv file of our choosing.  An example of an API search query is below.\n",

    "* <b>Foursquare API</b> (https://developer.foursquare.com/)<br> \n",
    "    Foursquare has an API which enables the user to query nearby venues of interest when the latitude and longitude of an address is entered.  We will use the \"Venue Search\" call.  The information for this API can be found here: https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api-reference/venues/search/.  It is important to note that the free unverified API only allows 950 search calls a day.  Therefore, having a list of 100 houses to search for 7 distinct amenities will result in 700 calls to the API.  This makes it important to narrow down the list of homes searched by using well selected criteria.  If this is an issue, the number of calls can be increased to 99,500 per day by verifying the account with a credit card."
