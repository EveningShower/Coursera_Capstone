    "In the search for a new home, it is generally easy to identify various characteristics such as price, square footage, or number of bedrooms and search for properties using well-known sites such as Zillow.com, Realtor.com, or Redfin.com.  However, if you desire to investigate nearby amenities of each neighborhood or city, that typically involves looking up each address individually to judge suitability.  This project aims to streamline that process to narrow down the number of properties which will need to be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our clients are homeowners who came to our real estate office in Massachusetts.  They would like to relocate to a larger house due to a growing family.  They like the nearby amenities of their current neighborhood and would like to find a house in a neighborhood which offers similar nearby amenities.  Due to limited houses on the market, they also don't want to limit themselves to their current neighborhood.  Therefore, we will provide a means to input search parameters for the house, such as cost, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. in a specified county.  Next, each returned address will be used as the center point of an amenity search to determine if the required amenities are within the required distance for that amenity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filtered list which meets the required criteria should output relevant summary information which may help to narrow houses down further such as price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and names and proximity to required amenities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The required amenities as requested by the client are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Amenity | Distance |    | Amenity | Distance\n",
    "|:---------|:----------:|    |:---------|:----------:|\n",
    "| Park | 0.5 miles |    |Train Station| 2 miles|\n",
    "| Grocery Store | 2 miles |    |Golf Course| 4 miles |\n",
    "|Fire Station| 2 miles|    |Emergency Room| 5 miles|\n",
    "|Police Station| 2 miles|    |\n",

    "While this project is being developed for a single client, this situation is encountered enough that this script is being developed to help future clients and to be used as a marketing differentiator from other real estate offices."
